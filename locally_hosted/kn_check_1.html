<td style="width: 118px;">0</td>
<td style="width: 620px;">The answer is D. A Project Manager with a natural tendency to communicate upwards will ensure that the Program Manager is well-informed and will likely not think to keep their project team (downwards) well informed. The side effects of not being informed include project dissatisfaction, poor work quality, lack of team trust and late deliverables.</td>
