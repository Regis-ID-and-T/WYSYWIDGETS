# WYSYWIDGETS
Javascripts to extend LMS WYSIWYG tools<br>
(LMS = "Learning Management System" eg. D2L, Canvas, Moodle)<br>
(WYSIWYG = "What You See Is What You Get" eg. MS Word, Facebook posting interface)

Most learning management systems' WYSIWYG tools directly allow professors only to make and edit static content.<br>(Indirectly, professors can add dynamic content by embedding externally hosted content into their pages.)

WYSYWIDGETS are sets of javascript that, when placed into html files (and quizzes), allow professors to make and edit dynamic content.


Not all Learning Management Systems are set up the same way. Some LMSs allow users to pull css and javascript files from external sources while others do not. With this in mind, we have provided sub-directories for each case. If your LMS allows you to call external javascript, then dive into the "externally_hosted" directory, else, dive on into the "header_only" directory.



In each directory there is a "How-To" html file that can help you use a wysywidget, but only after you've already 'installed' wysywidgets in your course.
