# WYSYWIDGETS
Javascripts to extend LMS WYSIWYG tools
(WYSIWYG = "What You See Is What You Get")

Most learning management systems' WYSIWYG tools allow professors only to make and edit static content.

WYSYWIDGETS are sets of javascript that, when placed into html files (and quizzes), allow professors to make and edit dynamic content.


Not all Learning Management Systems are set up the same way. In some LMSs allow users to pull css and javascript files from external sources while others do not. With this in mind, we have provided sub-directories for each case. If your LMS allows you to call external javascript, then dive into the "externally_enabled" directory, else, dive on into the "header_only" directory.
