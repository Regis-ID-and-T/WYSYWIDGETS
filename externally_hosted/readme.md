When your LMS is set up to allow you to make calls to externally hosted javascript and css files,
you can use the files found in this "externally_hosted" directory.

Make sure to grab copies of all of the css and js files from the "locally_hosted" directory and place them on your own server.
Then, get the urls for your self-hosted css and js files and use those urls in place of the regis urls seen in these html files.
